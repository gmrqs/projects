    "In this notebook I'll briefly show how to simply automate any transaction queries in SAP R/3 (or most of them anyway...) with a _hybrid solution_ with Python and VB Scripting\n",
    "\n",
    "SAP R/3 has a built-in recorder that is just like a MS Excel Macro Recorder. It records every action you would do in a session and write a script with everything that has been done and this will be essential for our tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example I'll automate a FBL3N report extraction. It consists in:\n",
    "- Setting a list accounts;\n",
    "- Setting a list of companies;\n",
    "- Setting a time range;\n",
    "- Choosing a Layout;\n",
    "- Executing the transaction;\n",
    "- Exporting the report for a local file (.xls);\n",
    "\n",
    "All these actions can be recorded with the SAP GUI Recorder and made into vbs scripts. You can check the vbs_scripts folder for those files, but it's probabbly best if you record yours yourself since sometimes these ERP systems are build differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some input info like the 'list of accounts' and 'list of companies' are very dense lists, containing hundreds of items, so it is best if you build a dataframe containing these information you want to use as query parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "SAP also works with _copy and paste_ (good'ol ctrl+c/ctrl+v), and you can gain a lot of speed by using these commands in your recordings. So i'll present a function that copies a column of a dataframe to your cliboard, so your vbs scripts can paste it in SAP."
